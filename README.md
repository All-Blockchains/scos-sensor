SCOS Sensor is a work-in-progress reference implementation of the [IEEE 802.15.22.3
Spectrum Characterization and Occupancy Sensing][ieee-link] (SCOS) sensor developed by
[NTIA/ITS]. SCOS Sensor defines a RESTful application programming interface (API),
that allows authorized users to discover capabilities, schedule actions, and acquire
resultant data.

## Getting Started

The [SCOS Sensor Wiki](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/wiki) contains helpful
information for getting up-and-running with SCOS Sensor, both as a user and as a
developer wishing to contribute to the project. There are also tutorials available on
the wiki to walk you through running SCOS Sensor either
[with](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/wiki/Tutorial-2:-Run-SCOS-Sensor-with-an-Attached-Signal-Analyzer)
or [without](https://github.com/NTIA/scos-sensor/wiki/Tutorial-1:-Run-SCOS-with-a-Mock-Signal-Analyzer)
sensor hardware. Finally, comprehensive API documentation is available
[here](https://ntia.github.io/scos-sensor/).
